## Experiment setting

    Learning rate: Cyclic learning rate(Linearly increase to 0.2 and decrease back to 0)

    Weight Decay: 5e-4

    Batch Size: 128

    Loss function: Label Smoothing = 0.1

    Optimizer: SGD with momentem = 0.9

    Batch Normalization Mode: Eval

    Use mixed-precision to accelerate training.
